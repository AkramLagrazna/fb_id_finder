Facebook ID Profile Finder


Hello to the Facebook ID profile finder, i wrote this in 10 mins because i am **bored** 
and i love to challenge myself.
Basically what this does is to return basic infomation of a facebook account if the user gives a fb user id
The script connects directly to graph.facebook.com and return a json
**enjoy**
